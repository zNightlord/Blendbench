# Blendbench

An extra extension for Modelbench to convert Minecraft json file and backwards. Blockbench <-> Modelbench :) 
I mainly work with Blender to export json.... so maybe addon?

*currently as a standalone run with python*


TODO:
- ***UV not Done*** 
Box UV and uv unwrap.

- Intergrate as Blender addon?


Needed python with numpy to run.
